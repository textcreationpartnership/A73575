            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A GENERALL REMEMBRANCE FOR A SERVANT WHEN HE FIRST trauelleth to the Sea, as to Spaine or Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingale, or other countreyes.</head>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> GENERAL remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance for you my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant I. A. that when it pleaſeth God you ſhall trauell vnto the ſea, firſt &amp; principally you doe not forget v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon your fafe arriuall at your Port, to giue vnto God moſt hartie and humble<note n="*" place="margin">For to feare God, and to be thankefull vnto him, is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of all happineſſe and proſperitie in our affaires.</note> thankes for his gracious protection of you, by ſaying as in token of your thankefulneſſe, ſome godly prayer of thankeſgiuing, or ſay onely with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence the Lords prayer, giuing him withall thankes in ſome wordes of your owne ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that preſently vpon your arriuall, you doe make diligent inquirie, whether anie
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:150812:6"/> ſhips be bound either to this Port of Briſtowe, or to any part of England. And then haue eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall care, that the neereſt that commeth to this Port, you write letters by them vnto me, and to them that you haue to deale for, of the arriuall of your ſhip: according to this plaine and briefe forme of inditing, as I will hereafter ſhew you. And ſo write likewiſe by your firſt letters, of the ſtate of your buſineſſe, and of the newes of the country, according as that time paſſeth. And when you haue learned of anie ſhip that commeth for England, doe not your ſelfe make it<note n="*" place="margin">This I ſay: to procure the more care and diligence in a youth.</note> knowen to anie bodie at all: but write and deliuer your letters ſecretlie, for it ſhall ſound much to your eſpeciall credit and good liking, when your diligence ſhall be ſo ſeene, that your letters ſhall ſhew the firſt arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall of your Ship: becauſe it is the thing that euerie Marchant doth eſpecially long after to vnderſtand.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, deale cloſely &amp; ſecretly in all your affaires and buſynes, and before you enterpriſe any thing, doe you after curteous and gentle manner aske counſel, either of ſome Marchant in the Ship, or your Hoſte, or of ſome Engliſh man: how you are to deale about your wares, both touching the landing it, the cuſtoming it, the ſelling it, the receauing of your moneyes, the buying of any wares againe, the cuſtoming the ſame againe, and to haue out all your writs
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:150812:6"/> and diſpatches for euery ſuch thing, as is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to be had. And hauing bin thus once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, do you with carefullnes remember it of your ſelfe againſt another time. Alſo be ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt in noting &amp; marking euery thing that you may, but be your ſelfe as ſecret and ſilent as is poſſible.</p>
            <p>Fourthly in any caſe ſhew your ſelfe lowly, curteous, and ſeruiceable vnto euery perſon: for though you &amp; many of vs elſe may think, that too much lowlineſſe bringeth contempt and diſgrace vnto vs: yet aſſuredly (it is wel known by experience) that there ſpringeth of no one vertue ſo great fruit vnto vs, as of gentleneſſe and humilitie: for it will both appeaſe the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and ill will of our enemies, &amp; encreaſe the good will of our friends. Alſo in any wiſe be not ſeduced by any perſon, to play at any kinde of game, eſpecially dice or cards, nor to vſe fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting or banketing, or keeping company with women, nor to go fine and coſtly in apparell: for all theſe things are eſpecially noted, and doe bring any yong beginner to vtter diſcredit and vndoing.</p>
            <p>Fiftly carie this for an eſpeciall note, that whenſoeuer you haue dealings for anie mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, you do in all things and euerie point obſerue according to their commiſſion and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. For although I knowe, it will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeeme to your ſelfe, that you ſhall better
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:150812:7"/> pleaſe your marchant, not to buy thoſe wares which he appointeth, becauſe of the deareneſſe of them: yet (I ſay) you ſhall giue euermore beſt contentment to your marchant, and ſaue your ſelfe harmeleſſe, when you followe his owne order and remembrance. And take this alſo for a caueat, that you neuer think the ſame ware which is beſt cheape, and is moſt bought vp, that it will be beſt to beſtow your money theron: for ordinarily it falleth out, that the quantitie of the beſt cheape wares that is brought home, hath ſmaller vtterance and leſſe profite, then ſuch deare wares as there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth but very litle quantitie of. Alſo be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in ſetting vp ſafely your money when you haue receaued it: and likewiſe be warie whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you receiue your moneys for your wares, crauing the paines of ſome marchant your freind, as to helpe you the firſt time to receaue it for you, vntill you haue more knowledge to receaue it your ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Moreouer be you in any wiſe circumſpect touching your behauiour when you be in the countrey of Spaine or elſe where: and ſhewe your ſelfe lowly and courteous to all people, and learne what be their ciuill lawes and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, and be carefull to keepe them. If anie of the rude and common ſort of people (as ſo it is in all countreys) will by chaunce offer you anie abuſe or wrong, appeaſe them againe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:150812:7"/> by ſufferance and gentleneſſe, then by reuenge: for ſo ſhall you beſt quiet your ſelfe, &amp; ouercome your enemie. In the ſales of your wares, doe you, before you ſet price of it to any man, make inquirie howe other Engliſh men haue ſold the like commodities, and ſo do you accordingly ſet priſe of yours. And lightly doe not refuſe the ſecond or third chapmans offer: for moſt ordinarily it falleth out, that the firſt and fourth offer is neuer ſo good as the third offer: but in this you are to haue a good inſight your ſelfe, and to do according as is your haſt and neceſſitie for your ſales.</p>
            <p>Be moſt faithful &amp; iuſt in all your accompts with euery man, &amp; defraud no man willingly not the value of a farthing. See that at no time you do take any mans doings or dealings into your hands, without my leaue and counſell: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by the trouble of other mens buſineſſe, you may neglect &amp; fruſtrate mine owne. And haue alſo regarde, for thoſe ſmall aduentures which I ſhall licence you to make for your owne priuate benefit, that euery voiage you doe deliuer mean accompt of it, wherby from time to time I may ſee and know your eſtate, and what of right doeth aperteine vnto you. Be circumſpect and nigh in all your expences; making your reckoning, that what you now ſpare and ſaue vnto me, it may grow the more to your owne benefit in time to come.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:150812:8"/>
            <p>Laſtely let this be yet your firſt and chiefeſt point in all your actions: that eſpecially you o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit not your dutifull ſeruice towards almighty God, but euerie morning and night, to pray that God will ſtill proſper and protect you, &amp; to giue him humble thankes that he hitherto hath alwayes mercifully defended you. And this doe you performe, by ſaying ſilentlie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerently, &amp; atentiuely, ſuch praiers as you haue learned by hart: or it your memorie cannot well reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber any other praier, ſay only to the praiſe of the bleſſed Trinity, the * Lords praier and the<note n="*" place="margin">This order of prayer I haue thought, might be good and godly: both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the country beyond the ſeas, and becauſe of mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chants lets and hinderance to continue in long prayer.</note> Creed, vſing euermore withall theſe three pointes of meditation. Firſt, to meditate your ſinnes, and aske God hartely mercy, and ſtedfaſtly purpoſe amendment. Secondly, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate Gods benefits: and humbly thanke him. Thirdly, meditate your neceſsities: and craue his holy helpe for them. The which you may then conlude the effect of theſe meditations, by ſaying laſtly againe the Lords praier. And this dutifull exerciſe of praier, I do require you neuer once to pretermit both at morning &amp; at night, how haſtie and vrgent ſoeuer be your buſineſſe For how great equitie &amp; reaſon is it, that we ſhould ſpend at the leaſt one halfe houre or litle moment of the day in thanks, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and mindfullnes of God: who is both carefull &amp; mindfull to ſerue &amp; ſuccour vs, euen all the whole day and euer all our life long. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:150812:8"/> neuer ſit downe, or riſe vp from meat, but be mindfull of God: &amp; in expreſsing your thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing, ſay ſome Godly grace or other: or on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay (rather then faile) no more then, <hi>In the name of the father, of the ſonne, &amp; of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> &amp; let thoſe wordes ſhew your thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to God. Finally in all your actions, vſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, conſcience, ſilence and patience. Thus making no doubte, but if you be mindfull of your dutie and ſeruice to God, all thinges ſhall go well and haue happy ſucceſſe that you take in hand. But the contrarie doing: your labours will not proſper, nor anie thing that you doe, will euer come to good paſſe or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. The holy Ghoſt be euermore your Protector.</p>

            <head>HERE FOLLOVVE CER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAINE GODLY SENTENCES, NE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie for a youth to meditate vpon.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>IRST ſeeke the kingdome of God and the righteouſneſſe thereof: and then all things ſhall be giuen thee that thou haſt neede of.</p>
            <p>Apply thy ſelfe vnto labour while thou art young, leſt in thine old age thy body become full of diſeaſes, and thy ende be in reproch and pouertie.</p>
            <p>The godly and diligent man ſhall haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie in all his wayes: but he that followeth pleaſure and voluptuouſneſſe, ſhall haue much ſorow before he die.</p>
            <p>Take heede of vſing a falſe ballance or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, for it is an abhomination before God: and a ſwearing and lying tongue, maketh hote the curſe of God vpon his houſe.</p>
            <p>Couet not ouermuch familiaritie amongſt men: for it maketh thee ſpend much loſſe of time.</p>
            <p>Let not thy expences be equall with thy
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:150812:36"/> gaynes: for either Sicknes, naughtie dettors, let of trade, and misfortune by the ſea or land, may ſoone ouetthrow thee.</p>
            <p>Linke not in amity with too many me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are aboue thy calling: for it will much increaſe thy trouble and charge.</p>
            <p>Beware in any caſe of ſuertiſhip: for it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth thy friend thine enemy; it indangereth thy eſtate; and impaireth thy owne credit.</p>
            <p>Be not haſty in giuing credit to euery man; but take heed to a man that is ful of words, that hath red eyes, that goeth much to law, and that is ſuſpected to liue vnchaſte.</p>
            <p>When thou promiſeſt any thing: be not ſlacke to performe it, for he that giueth quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, giueth double.</p>
            <p>If either of goodwill or necesſity thou muſt doe a thing, ſee thou do it gladly &amp; cheerfully: for ſo ſhall thy gift be well accepted, &amp; thy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and coſt neuer a whit the more.</p>
            <p>Remember often thy Creator, and how he hath made the whol compaſſe of the day and night to ſerue thee, but thee to ſerue only him. Wherefore if thou requite not thy maker, to ſerue him one houre or litle mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the day, for foure and twenty houres which he ſerueth thee: for thy beaſtly vnthankfulnes thou haſt loſt both thy light in this world, and ſhalt find darknes in the world to come.</p>
            <p>If thou wilt proſper, pray: if thou wilt haue
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:150812:36"/> bleſſinges, reſtore what thou haſt euill got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: if thou wilt haue ioye of thy labours, be ſingle in thy tongue and eye, vſe no lying nor deceit.</p>
            <p>Thinke it not inough to refraine thee from doing euill: but know that it is alſo thy dutie to do that which is good. Therefore be ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for the praiſe of thy Creator: geue good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: put forwards thy Children &amp; ſeruants in the ſeruice of God: help the widow, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſſe, the ſtranger, the poore, and the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</p>
            <p>Do vnto another as thou wouldeſt be done to thy ſelfe: and offer not that vnto another, which thy ſelf wouldeſt take in offence.</p>
            <p>Be not greedy nor in luſt after that, which is both diſpleaſant vnto God; hurtfull to thy body; an enemy to thy ſoule; and a ſhortner of thy life: which is: Wine, Wealth, and Women.</p>
            <p>What winneth a man by whordome? euen but a moment any pleaſure; a preſent ſorrow to his minde; a perpetuall ſicknes to his bodie; and eternall damnation (without hartie repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and amendment) to his ſoul.</p>
            <p>What profiteth a man by deceit, forſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and diſsimulation? he heapeth to himſelfe the horrible vengeance of God? and ſeruantes who ſhall ſerue him the like; and offereth his ſoul as a pray vnto Sathan.</p>
            <pb n="64" facs="tcp:150812:37"/>
            <p>What auayleth it a man to fare delicately, &amp; to drinke much of pleaſant &amp; ſtrong drinks? His mouth receaueth twiſe ſo much bitterneſſe as it had before delight; he ſhall become cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt as the Tode, and ſhall returne to vomite with the dogge.</p>
            <p>What getteth a man by lying? Not to be beleeued when he ſpeaketh truth.</p>
            <p>Feare God: for he can deſtroy both thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and ſoule.</p>
            <p>Honor thy Prince: for ſhe hath power ouer life and death.</p>
            <p>Loue thy parents: for they are the beſt frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds thou ſhalt euer haue.</p>
            <p>Giue reuerence to thy betters: for therein thou ſhalt haue honor to thy ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Be curteous and lowly to all men: for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thine enemies report ſhalbe doubted of.</p>
            <p>Be not wiſe in thine owne conceipt: for thou canſt not know all thine owne imperfections.</p>
            <p>Be not carefull to pleaſe thine eye: for it is the deceiptfulleſt enemie thou haſt.</p>
            <p>Remember who made thee: it was God: remember of what thou waſt made: euen of earth and clay. Remember wherfore thou waſt made: to honor and glorifie God. Remember to what thou ſhalt be made: euen to duſt and aſhes. Remember to what thou mayſt be made againe: euen a glorious and immortall bodie.</p>
            <p>Who ſo taketh vpon him the degree of a
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:150812:37"/> ſeruant, let theſe three things be his chiefeſt thought and meditation. The firſt that euerie morning and euening, he performe his dutifull obedience and thankeſgiuing, by his prayers vnto God. The Second, that he alwayes carie in mind, what carefulneſſe, truth, and diligence, is required in his ſeruice towards his maiſter. The third, how he himſelfe may liue with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie and credit in time to come.</p>
            <div type="fable">
               <head>THE CONCLVSION, VVHICH is an hiſtorie very profitable and delightful for a youth to reade and meditate.</head>
               <p>THere was a certaine Philoſopher, who lying on his death bed, called his ſonne, &amp; ſayd theſe words vnto him. My ſonne when I thy father am dead, remember me by recomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting often vnto thy ſelfe this counſell which now I giue vnto thee. Firſt learne of the little ſinging birds, who neuer miſſe in the morning and at euening, but in their kinde, they yeeld foorth their voices in praiſe and reioycing of their Creator and maker: and ſo ſee that thou alſo do neuer forget &amp; neglect the ſame.</p>
               <p>Learne of the litle emet, that prouideth in the ſommer her foode for the winter: and ſo ſee that thou alſo in thy youth, labor for thy main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance againſt thine age. Learne of the cocke, that often watcheth and croweth in the night,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:150812:38"/> both to preſerue himſelf and his fellowes from the wefell: and ſo ſe that thou often watch, and ſtretch forth thy voice in prayer by night vnto God, and in that quiet time, ſtudie to preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thy dangers. Learne of the litle dog, who becauſe he is the humbleſt creature of all vnto man, is therfore moſt loued and eſteemed: &amp; ſo ſee that thou euermore ſhew thy ſelfe humble &amp; lowly vnto euery man. Learne of the ſilk worm, who as ſoone as ſhe gathereth ſtrength to yeeld anie vertue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her, neuer ceaſſeth nor waxeth wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vntill ſhe die: and ſo ſee that thou alſo conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t not thy ſelf, to do thy duty to God and man for a time, (as moſt men do) but ſtill continue in vertue till thy verie liues end.</p>
               <p>Thus my ſonne (quoth he) if thou wilt obey this my counſell, it ſhall alwayes go well with thee: but contrariwiſe if thou forſake it, &amp; fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thine owne imaginations, it will happen vnto thee according to this example. There dwelt by a foreſt ſide a ſhepheard, who to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue his ſheepe from a lion, which oftentimes had caried them away for a pray to his whelp, prepared many ſnares and engines to deſtroy this lion: but the old lio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perceauing theſe traps to be layd for him, departed with his yong one to another forreſt. But when the whelp grewe to be as big a lion as his father, he thus ſaith vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: Father me thinks I can remember that this place is not the cuntrey where I was born,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:150812:38"/> what then was the cauſe that made thee to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part there hence? Saith the old lion, my ſonne it is not indeed our natiue cuntrey: but there is a litle dwarf a man dwelling in that place, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for his ſubtle traps that he laid to take from me my life, I feared, and ſo fled therehence. Saith the yong lion: and I ſweare by my beard that I will be reuenged of him, and will go now and teare him in peeces with my teeth. Nay (ſayth the old lion) do not ſo, for if I my ſelf could not poſſibly get reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge againſt him, thou canſt not in any ſort do it. But the yong lion would not be ruled by his father, but goeth vnto this foreſt where the ſhepheard dwelt: who finding him within his houſe &amp; the dores ſhut, called vnto him and ſayd, ô thou naughtie &amp; vile wretch, why haſt thou ſo abuſed my father, as to driue him from his natiue cuntrey, ouer which &amp; all the beaſts therof, he raigned as king: I tell thee that I his ſonne wilbe reuenged of thee for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him ſo to looſe his right. The man being within his houſe ſtoutly anſwered: I regard not a ruſh either thee or thy father, but if thou once offer to enter within my doores, I haue here both my ſtaffe and my axe to beate and to cut thee in peeces. The yong lion was ſtraight wayes amazed at his ſtout wordes, and ſayde: then come thou forth, and go with me to yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der moyle, and let him be iudge betwixt thee &amp; me, whether thou haſt done my father wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g or not, Saith the ſhepheard: if thou wilt adiure
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:150812:39"/> and ſweare to do me no harme, I will go with thee. So the yong lion ſware vnto him to doe him no harme. The man then leadeth the way vnto the lion, by thoſe engins that he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared long before: and anon the yong lion fell into one of his pits, and was entangled by his 2 forefeet. O (ſaith the lion) helpe me, for I know not what is this that hath bound my feete verie faſt together. Saith the ſhepheard, I am not able to helpe thee, but tary thou here, and I will go and call hither the moile. But the lion as well as he could, did yet get forth of the pit, &amp; went iumping and leaping to follow after the man. By and by againe he fel into another pit, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by his two hinder leggs were alſo caught faſt. The ſhepheard now ſeeing him well tyed and bound: he then cutteth with his knife a good greene ſtaffe, &amp; beginneth to lay blows ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gly vpon the lion. The lion then remembred his father, and ſaid to the man: ô beat me not on my back nor my belly, but rather beat me on mine eares &amp; on my heart: becauſe with mine eares I would not heare the counſel of my father, nor with my heart would not beleeue it, when he ſaid thou hadſt more ſubtlety to preuaile, then I had ſtrength. So the man beat him ſo long, both on the eares and the heart, that in the end he killed him. Euen ſo (ſaith the Philoſopher to his ſonne) will deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> come vpon thoſe which ſhall not accept &amp; obey the good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell and inſtructions of their aged fathers.</p>
